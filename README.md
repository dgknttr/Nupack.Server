## üöÄ Getting Started - Deploy Your Private NuGet Server

Set up your own **self-hosted NuGet package repository** in minutes! This guide will help you deploy a **private NuGet server** that serves as a powerful **NuGet.Server alternative** for your organization.

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK (or .NET 8.0 for compatibility)
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment
- (Optional) Node.js for CSS development

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgknttr/nupack-server.git
cd nupack-server
```

> **Note**: This is an open-source project. Feel free to fork, modify, and adapt it to your needs!

### 2. Configuration
Copy the example configuration:
```bash
cp src/Nupack.Server.Web/appsettings.example.json src/Nupack.Server.Web/appsettings.json
```

Update `appsettings.json` with your deployment details:
```json
{
  "Branding": {
    "CompanyName": "Your Company Name",
    "NugetSourceUrl": "https://nuget.yourdomain.com/v3/index.json"
  },
  "PackageStorage": {
    "BasePath": null
  }
}
```

#### Package Storage Configuration
You can configure where packages are physically stored:

- **Default** (`null`): Uses `packages` folder in WebRootPath or ContentRootPath
- **Relative path**: `"data/packages"` - relative to application root
- **Absolute path**: `"/var/nuget/packages"` or `"C:/NuGet/Packages"`
- **Environment variables**: `"${NUGET_PACKAGES_PATH}"` or `"${HOME}/nuget-packages"`

See [Package Storage Configuration](docs/package-storage-configuration.md) for detailed examples and deployment scenarios.

> **Note**: Only `CompanyName` and `NugetSourceUrl` are configurable. All other branding elements are fixed to maintain consistent "Nupack Server" identity.

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
# Start both API and Web UI
dotnet run --project src/Nupack.Server.Api --urls "http://localhost:5003" &
dotnet run --project src/Nupack.Server.Web --urls "http://localhost:5004"
```

### 4. Access the Server
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:5004
- **NuGet API Endpoint**: http://localhost:5003/v3/index.json

## üåç Open Source Benefits

This project is designed to serve the broader .NET and NuGet community by providing:

### For Developers
- **Learning Resource** - Study a real-world NuGet server implementation
- **Customization Base** - Fork and modify for specific needs
- **No Vendor Lock-in** - Full control over your package hosting

### For Organizations
- **Cost-Effective** - Free alternative to commercial NuGet hosting
- **Privacy Control** - Keep sensitive packages on your own infrastructure
- **Compliance** - Meet specific security and regulatory requirements

### For the Community
- **Collaborative Development** - Community-driven improvements and features
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Learn from and contribute to open-source practices
- **Ecosystem Growth** - Strengthen the .NET package management ecosystem

## üì¶ Using the Server

### Publishing Packages
```bash
# Upload packages using dotnet CLI
dotnet nuget push package.nupkg --source http://localhost:5003/v3/index.json

# Or use the web interface upload page
# Navigate to http://localhost:5004/Upload
```

### Installing Packages
```bash
# Add the server as a package source
dotnet nuget add source "https://your-nuget-server.com/v3/index.json" --name "Nupack Server"

# Install packages from your server
dotnet add package YourPackage --source "Nupack Server"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Branding Options
Only two values are configurable through `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Branding": {
    "CompanyName": "Your Organization",
    "NugetSourceUrl": "https://nuget.yourdomain.com/v3/index.json"
  }
}
```

All other branding elements (ProductName, RepositoryTitle, etc.) are fixed to maintain consistent "Nupack Server" identity across all deployments.

### Available Pages
- **Home** (`/`) - Package overview and statistics
- **Search** (`/Search`) - Search and filter packages
- **Package Details** (`/Packages/Details/{id}`) - Detailed package information
- **Upload** (`/Upload`) - Upload new packages via web interface

### üéØ Real-World Use Cases & Scenarios

#### üè¢ **Enterprise & Corporate Scenarios**
- **Internal Package Repository**: Host proprietary .NET libraries and shared components across development teams
- **Microservices Architecture**: Centralized package management for distributed systems and service libraries
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automated package publishing and consumption in DevOps workflows
- **Compliance & Security**: Keep sensitive packages on-premises to meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- **Multi-Team Collaboration**: Share reusable components between different departments and projects

#### üåê **Community & Open Source Scenarios**
- **Open Source Project Hosting**: Alternative to nuget.org for community packages and pre-release versions
- **Regional Package Mirrors**: Faster package access for specific geographic regions or organizations
- **Educational Institutions**: Teaching package management and software distribution concepts
- **Startup & Small Teams**: Cost-effective alternative to commercial NuGet hosting services
- **Development Sandbox**: Testing and experimenting with package distribution before public release

#### üîß **Technical & Development Scenarios**
- **Offline Development**: Air-gapped environments where internet access is restricted
- **Custom Package Workflows**: Specialized package validation, approval, and distribution processes
- **Legacy System Support**: Hosting older package versions not available on public repositories
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced latency and bandwidth usage for frequently accessed packages
- **Backup & Redundancy**: Secondary package repository for business continuity planning

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The project includes a Docker setup for easy deployment:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both the API server and web interface with the following ports:
- **API Server**: http://localhost:5003 (HTTP), https://localhost:5001 (HTTPS)
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:5004 (HTTP), https://localhost:5002 (HTTPS)

You can customize the configuration by editing the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## üîß Additional Configuration

### Environment Variables
Configuration values can be overridden using environment variables:

```bash
# Example environment variables
Branding__ProductName="Custom NuGet Server"
Branding__CompanyName="Custom Company"
NuGetServer__BaseUrl="https://your-domain.com"
```

### Health Monitoring
- **Web UI Health**: `http://localhost:5004/health`
- **API Health**: `http://localhost:5003/health`

Both endpoints return JSON with basic server status information.
